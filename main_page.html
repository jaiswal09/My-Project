It was founded in 1922 by an Act of the Central Legislative Assembly. The Vice President of India serves as the university chancellor. The university is ranked 6th by National Institutional Ranking Framework 2024.

                History
                The University of Delhi was established in 1922 was created by act of Central Legislative assembly.[8] Hari Singh Gour served as the university's first Vice-Chancellor from 1922 to 1926.
                
                Only four colleges existed in Delhi at the time, which were affiliated to University of the Punjab at that time:
                
                St. Stephen's College founded in 1881.
                Hindu College founded in 1899.
                Zakir Husain Delhi College (then known as The Delhi College), founded in 1792 and
                Ramjas College founded in 1917.
                All of the above colleges were subsequently affiliated to the university. The university initially had two faculties (Arts and Science) and approximately 750 students.
                
                The seat of power in British India had been transferred from Calcutta to Delhi in 1911. The Viceregal Lodge Estate became the residence of the Viceroy of India until October 1933, when it was given to the University of Delhi. Since then, it has housed the office of the vice-chancellor and other offices.[9]
                
                When Sir Maurice Gwyer came to India in 1937 to serve as Chief Justice of British India, he became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Delhi. During his time, postgraduate teaching courses were introduced and laboratories were established at the university.[10] Members of the faculty included Daulat Singh Kothari in Physics and Panchanan Maheshwari in Botany. Gwyer has been called the "maker of the university". He served as Vice-Chancellor until 1950.[11]
                
                The silver jubilee year of the university in 1947 coincided with India's independence, and the national flag was hoisted in the main building for the first time by Vijayendra Kasturi Ranga Varadaraja Rao. In that year there was no convocation ceremony due to the partition of India. Instead, a special ceremony was held in 1948, attended by then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru, as well as by Lord Mountbatten, Lady Mountbatten, Abul Kalam Azad, Zakir Husain and Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar. Twenty-five years later the golden jubilee celebrations of 1973 were attended by the then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, Satyajit Ray, Amrita Pritam, and M. S. Subbulakshmi.[12]
                
                Present form
                The university has grown into one of the largest universities in India. There are 16 faculties, 86 academic departments, 91 colleges spread across the city, with 132,435 regular students (114,494 undergraduates and 17,941 postgraduates). There are 261,169 students in non-formal education programmes (258,831 undergraduates and 2,338 postgraduates). DU's chemistry, geology, zoology, sociology, and history departments have been awarded the status of Centres of Advanced Studies. In addition, a number of the university's departments receive grants under the Special Assistance Programme of the University Grants Commission in recognition of their outstanding academic work.[13]
                
                From the year 2022, DU changed its admission pattern from the 12th percentage mark based to CUET[14] (Common University Entrance Test). Now it will admit students based on their CUET scores. And the 12th class percentage marks will act as a tie-breaker for students securing the same CUET scores.[15]
                
                DU is one of the most sought-after institutions of higher education in India. It also has one of the highest publication counts among Indian universities.[16]
